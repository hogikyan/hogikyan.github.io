# Air-Sea Interaction in the Climate System


My work aims to improve basic understanding of how the coupled ocean-atmosphere system responds to forcing using both climate model experiments and observations, interpreted in a physically relevant state space. I study how coupled energetics and dynamics constrain oceanic heat, oxygen and carbon content and distribution on short (monthly) and long (decadal to centennial) timescales.
